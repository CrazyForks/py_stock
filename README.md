#### Introduction
Recently, the stock market has been stirring up, wandering around 3000 points, recalling the past experience of stock speculation, vivid in my mind, the tragic experience of people sad, last year, a total of 4000 yuan into the market, and finally only 1000 more than the last, no choice but to shut down and practice, forget the stock market, fully committed to the world of code, to enjoy the fun of the code. Recently, when I saw others use python to quantitatively invest in the news of the rich, suddenly invigorated, and immediately learn the way of python data analysis, the development of a stock market quotation board, hoping to borrow the power of python, as soon as possible to achieve financial freedom, and to reach the pinnacle of life!
